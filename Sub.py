# In this competition, we aim to develop AI models that can accurately classify degenerative conditions of the lumbar spine using MRI images. Specifically, the objective is to create models that can simulate a radiologist's performance in diagnosing five key lumbar spine degenerative conditions: Left Neural Foraminal Narrowing, Right Neural Foraminal Narrowing, Left Subarticular Stenosis, Right Subarticular Stenosis, and Spinal Canal Stenosis.The goal of this project is to develop AI models to identify and classify degenerative conditions affecting the lumbar spine using MRI scans annotated by spine radiology specialists. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to tackle this project:
# 
# This guide will walk you through the process of building and fine-tuning models to detect and classify these conditions. Leveraging advanced machine learning frameworks and techniques, participants can create robust models capable of interpreting MRI scans with high accuracy.
# 
# **Did you know:**: This notebook is backend-agnostic? Which means it supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX backends. However, the best performance can be achieved with `JAX`. KerasNLP and Keras enable the choice of preferred backend. Explore further details on [Keras](https://keras.io/keras_3/).
# 
# **Note**: For a deeper understanding of KerasNLP, refer to the [KerasNLP guides](https://keras.io/keras_nlp/).
# 
# By participating in this challenge, you will contribute to the advancement of medical imaging and diagnostic radiology, potentially impacting patient care and treatment outcomes positively. Let's get started on building powerful AI models to enhance the detection and classification of lumbar spine degenerative conditions.
